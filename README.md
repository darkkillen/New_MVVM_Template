# Dependencies

| Tech | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [android lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) | Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain. See the reference docs for more information. |
| [data binding](https://github.com/square/retrofit) | Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc. |
| [dexter](https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter) | Dexter is an Android library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime. |
| [glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) | Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.. |
| [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) | Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. |
| [koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) | A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers. |
| [ktx](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) | Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc. |
| [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) | Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs. To do so, these extensions leverage several Kotlin language features, including the following: Extension functions, Extension properties, Lambdas, Named parameters and Parameter default values. |
| [room](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/room/package-summary) | The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. |
| [timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) | This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class. |
